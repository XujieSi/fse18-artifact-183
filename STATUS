We are applying for the reusable and available badges.

We believe this artifact is reusable since the input is in a simple format that can be easily produced.

The artifact is under the MIT License and is therefore available. We will soon publicize this tool in a Github repository.

We also include our benchmarks, which may be useful for future work in ILP and Datalog synthesis.
